# 🌦️ Weather 24/7 – Your Around the Clock Weather Companion

**Weather 24/7** is a responsive, web‑based weather application that provides users with real‑time weather updates and forecasts in a visually engaging interface.

## 🎯 What purpose does this website serve?

- Delivers current weather conditions and forecast at any time of day—literally 24/7.
- Helps users quickly check local weather in a clean and easy-to-use format.
- Designed for both desktop and mobile users, offering an intuitive experience.

## ⚙️ How it works

- Users can **search for a city or location**.
- The site fetches **weather data** from an external API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and updates the interface dynamically.
- Visual elements like icons (sun, cloud, rain, etc.) update based on weather conditions.
- Backgrounds or thematic imagery reflect different weather states (e.g. clear, cloudy, rainy).
